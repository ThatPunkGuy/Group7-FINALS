                        <br><br>
                        Teaching and learning activities (TLAs) as well as assessment tasks(TAs) are delivered through a blend of both synchronous and asynchronous methods. 
                        Synchronous is live or real time. Asynchronous online teaching is where teaching materials are posted online, and students work through the TLAs and ATs 
                        in their own time, communicating with each other and the teacher using the Canvas LMS facilities such as discussion boards, assignments, among others. 
                        Live conferences are conducted via Google Meet, Zoom , among others.

                        Instructors can upload videos that can be downloaded and viewed offline. Recorded live conferences can also be saved. 
                        Students may request their instructors to send the recorded discussions for their offline viewing.
