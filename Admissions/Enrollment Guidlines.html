                    <p>A student who has complied with all the admission requirements is qualified to enrol. His name must appear the same on birth certificate and admission credentials. In the case of married female students, an authenticated copy of the marriage certificate must be submitted to the Registrar's Office.</p>

                            <li>Proper sequencing of courses, i.e., taking prerequisite courses before the next higher courses, should be strictly observed; otherwise, the registration maybe invalidated and no credit will be applied despite the grades obtained.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>A grade of 5.00 (Failed) in any prerequisite course disqualifies a student from enroling in the next higher course.</li>
                            <br>    
                            <li>If the grade obtained is 4.00 (No Credit), a student shall retake the course within the prescribed one-year period or the mark automatically becomes 5.00 (Failed).</li>

                            <li>A student who has not completed the required PE and NSTP units after five (5) semesters will not be allowed to carry an 18-unit load including PE and NSTP, unless justifiable reasons are presented.</li>

                            <li>A student who has been dropped from the roll or expelled due to infractions of school rules and regulations shall not be readmitted.</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>As a general rule, any student who wishes to discontinue his studies during the semester must notify in writing the Registrar, through the Head of Students Affairs/Department Chair, and copy furnish the Student Accounting Section Head. The parents or guardian of the student must note the letter if the student is a minor. Failure to submit the letter is tantamount to forfeiture of the student's rights to any refund of fees.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A student who registers his withdrawal within two weeks after the beginning of classes and who has fully paid the pertinent fees may apply for a refund. With his application for refund stamped and received by the Student Accounting Section within the same week, the student will be charged as follows:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ten percent (10%) of the total amount due for the term if he withdraws within the first week of classes whether he has attended classes or not.</li>
                        <li>Twenty percent (20%) of the total amount due for the term if he withdraws within the second week of classes whether he has attended classes or not.</li>
                        <li>The full fee if he withdraws any time after the second week of classes.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p>Because of the heavy workload during the registration period, the Student Accounting Section can accommodate refund claims usually one month after registration.</p>
