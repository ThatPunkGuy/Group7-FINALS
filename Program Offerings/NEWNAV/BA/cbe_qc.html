                            <h3><u>OUTCOMES-BASED EDUCATION (OBE)</u></h3>
                            <br>
                            <p>The T.I.P. Implementation of outcomes-based education was driven by the following
                                external entities: 1) Regulatory bodies such as the Commission on Higher Education
                                (CHED), the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC), International Maritime
                                Organization (IMO), among others, 2) Local and international accrediting bodies,
                                specifically, the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on
                                Accreditation (PACUCOA), the Philippine Technological Council-Accreditation and
                                Certification Board for Engineering and Technology - Engineering Accreditation
                                Commission (PTC - ACBET - EAC), and ABET, Inc., 3) International certifying bodies, and
                                4) Feedback from other external constituents.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>It is also guided by existing T.I.P. internal policies and initiatives: 1) The T.I.P.
                                Vision, Mission, Core Values, and Core Competencies, 2) T.I.P. Quality Policy, and 3)
                                Other T.I.P. initiatives that supported the OBE implementation such as a) the T.I.P.
                                Faculty and Staff Development Program, and b) The T.I.P. Student Development Program.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The institutional outcome statement was formulated based on the T.I.P. graduates
                                attributes. Outcomes at the program level and course level were also formulated aligned
                                with institutional outcomes.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The framework which T.I.P. adopted in its OBTL implementation revolves around three
                                important elements: 1) Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs), 2) Teaching and Learning
                                Activities (TLAs) and 3) Assessment Tasks (ATs).</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In support of T.I.P.’s outcomes-based education and as a strategy to promote academic
                                excellence, T.I.P. has also embarked on a proactive plan to implement outcomes-based
                                teaching and learning or OBTL in all its academic programs using the City University of
                                Hong Kong OBTL model.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The OBE process is also supported by facilities, management processes and procedures
                                resources and support structures sub-systems.</p>
                            <br>
                        </td>
                        <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">
                            <p>The results of the assessment and evaluation are used as inputs in the continual
                                improvement of the instructional process specifically on the constructive alignment of
                                ILOs, TLAs, and ATs.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>It is expected that the implementation of OBTL as part of T.I.P.’s OBE would hasten the
                                realization of T.I.P.’s mission "to transform students into graduates with full
                                competence in their fields of study and who also possess Filipino values,
                                industry-desired values, and global citizen values”.</p>

                            <p>In recent years, T.I.P. had the privilege to receive international and national
                                recognitions for providing quality education to students. The said recognitions are the
                                following:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><u>ISO Certification.</u>T.I.P.’s quality management system is certified to ISO 9001:2015
                                by Det Norske Veritas – Germanischer Lloyd (DNV-GL) in the provision of all its academic
                                offerings.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>This helps ensure that all training and education services consistently meet all customer
                                and applicable statutory, regulatory and accreditation requirements. This also helps
                                address customer satisfaction through the effective and efficient application of the
                                system, continual improvement, and the prevention of nonconformity. T.I.P. is one among
                                a select number of schools in the Philippines which went into ISO certification as early
                                as 19 years ago. To date, it continues to maintain its ISO certification.</p>

                            <p>Some of the notable components of T.I.P.’s QMS are: a) 5S, a Japanese-inspired good
                                housekeeping program, and b) KAIZEN, a continuous small-steps improvement program.</p>

                            <p>There can be no clearer confirmation of effective quality management than the distinction
                                of being benchmarked by one’s peers. Through the years, the institution has hosted
                                several benchmarking visits by presidents, officers, faculty and staff of other
                                institutions of higher learning, and other organizations, bringing to fore its modest
                                contribution to the sharing of effective policies and practices. To date, forty eight
                                (48) local institutions and organizations have benchmarked with T.I.P. Schools from
                                Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Cambodia have also benchmarked with the institution.</p>

                                awarded T.I.P. Manila with Autonomous Status. Autonomous status is the highest possible
                                award given by CHED to a higher education institution in recognition of its exemplary
                                performance shown in the provision of quality instruction, research and extension work.
