                            <p><img src="students.png" style="float: right; margin: 15px;">On February 8, 1962, a group
                                of educators headed by Engineer Demetrio A. Quirino Jr.
                                and Dr. Teresita U. Quirino established the TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF THE PHILIPPINES
                                as a private non-sectarian stock school.
                                T.I.P. laid down its objective based on its founders’ vision: 1) to maintain high
                                standards of instruction; 2) to bring within the reach of the masses the blessings
                                of higher education; and 3) to cooperate with the government in the implementation
                                of its economic and social amelioration programs.
                                The school committed itself to educating and developing men and women who could turn
                                the wheels of progress and industry. T.I.P.’s initial offering of courses included
                                Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering,
                                and Architecture. It also offered Industrial Education, Industrial Arts, Liberal Arts,
                                High School, and various trade courses.
                            </p>

                            <br>

                            <p>
                                T.I.P.’s first site was the Lorenzana Building in Quiapo, Manila. The school had an
                                initial enrollment of 2,400 which steadily increased throughout the years, prompting
                                the school to slowly but surely expand. In 1967, it set up its main site at G. Puyat
                                Street, Quiapo, Manila. T.I.P. then directed itself towards specialization in the
                                field of technology. In 1977, it offered a two-year associate course in Marine
                                Engineering. Then in 1980, the Liberal Arts, Education, and High School programs
                                were phased out to make way for the school’s new thrust. In 1981, additional buildings
                                were leased and the T.I.P. P. Casal, Quiapo location was opened to accommodate the
                                growing student population which had reached over 23,000.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                T.I.P. Arlegui was opened
                                three years later across P. Casal, both areas being collectively known as the T.I.P.
                                Manila campus. Currently, T.I.P. Manila has four (4) main buildings across the combined
                                2.3-hectares of the two sites. The founders opened T.I.P. Quezon City in 1983 along
                                20th Avenue of Cubao as their answer to the Philippine government’s call for dispersal
                                to decongest the Manila University Belt. Through the years, the Quezon City campus
                                acquired adjacent properties, including a frontage along Aurora Boulevard in the early
                                2000s. At present, T.I.P. Quezon City has ten (10) main buildings spread out in its
                                3.3-hectare site.

                            <p><img src="retro.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 15px;">T.I.P.’s institutional campaign
                                for quality began in 1999. The school’s
                                Quality Management System (QMS) was certified compliant with the international standard
                                ISO
                                9001:1994 by Det Norska Veritas (DNV) during this year. The T.I.P. QMS has since then
                                passed
                                regular ISO recertification and surveillance audits. The turn of the millennium also saw
                                T.I.P.’s campaign to externally validate the quality of its programs. From 2000 to the
                                present,
                                T.I.P. has been voluntarily applying its programs for local and international
                                accreditations
                                from respected organizations. These accreditations include ones from ABET, the US-based
                                global
                                gold standard in engineering and computing accreditation; the Seoul Accord, a
                                multilateral
                                agreement among agencies allowing professional mobility between the Philippines and the
                                pact’s
                                signatory countries; Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on
                                Accreditation
                                (PACUCOA) under the umbrella of the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the
                                Philippines (FAAP);
                                the Philippine Technological Council; and the Philippine Computer Society (PCS)
                                Information and
                                Computing Accreditation Board (PICAB).

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                During this period, the Commission on Higher Education
                                (CHED) also awarded 16 Centers of Excellence and Centers of Development to both T.I.P.
                                campuses.
                                Moreover, CHED also awarded Autonomous Status to both T.I.P. Quezon City and T.I.P.
                                Manila in
                                2016 and again in 2019. Autonomous status is the highest honor CHED can bestow upon a
                                higher
                                education institution. In response to the nationwide K-12 basic and secondary education
                                program implementation, T.I.P. applied for and was granted permit to offer a standalone
                                Senior High School
                                (SHS) program in 2015. The strands offered by the T.I.P. SHS currently include
                                Science, Technology, and Mathematics (STEM); Accountancy, Business, and Management
                                (ABM);
                                and Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS).
