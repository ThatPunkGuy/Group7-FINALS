                            <br>
                            <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic runs its course, we have been living in truly extraordinary times. Every aspect of our lives
                                 has instantaneously and drastically changed, including how students receive their education.(DNV-GL).
                                 Like all other schools, T.I.P. is forced to trade the familiarity of physical classrooms for the safety of remote 
                                 learning to ensure educational continuity. For now, online and 
                                 flexible learning shall be T.I.P.’s new norm until such a time when it is safe for the school community to once again be together, physically.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In recent years, T.I.P. had the privilege to receive international and national
                                recognitions for providing quality education to students. The said recognitions are the
                                following:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>We would like to assure everyone that despite this shift in modality, the quality of T.I.P.’s education remains the same. 
                                In fact, with the job market undoubtedly tougher during this pandemic, T.I.P. is further committed to providing its students 
                                with the best industry-relevant education they deserve. What this means is T.I.P. students shall graduate with full competence in 
                                their fields of study, equipped with the desirable traits highly sought after by employers. This is what T.I.P. ultimately seeks to 
                                accomplish and this has been our sole purpose from the very beginning:
                                 to provide a better life for Filipinos by empowering our students with the best globally competitive technological education.</p>

                                T.I.P. has consistently lived up to its vision of maintaining a high standard of instruction, bringing high-quality tertiary 
                                education within reach of most Filipinos, and forging strong ties with the government in the implementation of its economic and 
                                social amelioration programs. From an initial enrollment of 2,400 students,
                                T.I.P. currently has close to 20,000 students under its wing spread out over its campuses in Manila and Quezon City.</p><br>

                                while keeping strong ties with industry to keep T.I.P. education relevant. These shall ensure that graduates exceed employers’

                            <p>T.I.P.'s shift to online and flexible learning was done in a decisive and efficient manner. Within months from the start of the pandemic,
                                T.I.P. reengineered its education ecosystem, redesigned its processes, and further strengthened its IT infrastructure.
                                Teaching and non-teaching employees were trained for platform-appropriate educational delivery. Learning policies were revisited and 
                                crafted in consultation with students to make them more student-friendly. Furthermore, online student-centric initiatives were systematically 
                                lined up to ensure students were provided with a welcoming and meaningful online learning experience that they deserve.</p><br>

                                 It is one of the school's forward-thinking ways to make its education borderless and accessible. It is also T.I.P.'s

                                This educational model involves instilling core technopreneurship skills in T.I.P. students, faculty members, researchers, and other stakeholders.</p><br>
                            
                            <p>T.I.P. TechnoCoRe also aims to develop them into highly competent engineering and technology professionals by exposing 
                                them to experiential learning opportunities brought by active collaboration with the school's industry partners. 
                                They are able to then cascade these experiences, learnings, and insights to their students in the classroom, enabling 
                                deeper understanding and appreciation of theory as applied to practice. In rooting class discussions in real-world applications,

                            <p>20 T.I.P. engineering and computing programs have been ABET-accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC)
                                 and the Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) since 2013, followed by successful ABET program reaccreditation in 2019. 
                                 ABET is the USA-based global gold standard in engineering and computing accreditation, ensuring that a school’s programs meet current
                                  international standards and industry best practices. This means that T.I.P.
                                 students can enjoy quality education comparable to the ABET-accredited programs of internationally-acclaimed schools abroad.</p><br>

                            <p>The collectivity of T.I.P.'s online student-centric initiatives is called T.I.P. LEADS—Learning Experience using Alternative-Design Systems.
                                 It is one of the school's forward-thinking ways to make its education borderless and accessible. It is also T.I.P.'s

                            <br>
                            <p>Further, T.I.P.’s six computing programs remain recognized by the Seoul Accord, by virtue of their ABET CAC accreditation. 
                                The degrees of T.I.P. graduates in Computer Science, Information Science, and Information Technology are automatically recognized by the Seoul Accord signatory countries of the United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, South Korea,
                                 Australia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, allowing international job mobility for T.I.P. graduates.</p><br>
                            <p>  Additionally, T.I.P. recently passed the 2021 ISO 9001:2015 Surveillance Audit to ensure that the school's 
                                 quality management system (QMS) remains at par with those of the world’s best educational institutions. 
                                 This accomplishment means that T.I.P. 
                                 has had its QMS certified compliant to the latest ISO 9001 standards since 1999 or for 22 years.</p><br>
                            <p>Locally, T.I.P. enjoys the CHED Autonomous Status award for both T.I.P. Quezon City and T.I.P. Manila. T.I.P. also enjoys a total of 16 programs awarded as Centers of Excellence (COEs) 
                                and Centers of Development (CODs) by CHED—4 COEs and 4 CODs in T.I.P. Quezon City, and 4 COEs and 4 CODs in T.I.P. Manila. Both T.I.P. campuses have likewise retained 7 Engineering program accreditations 
                                each per campus from the Philippine Technological Council (PTC) and 3 Computing program accreditations each per campus from the Philippine Computer Society (PCS) Information and Computing

(PACUCOA) with a total of 24 accredited programs. Specifically, T.I.P. Quezon City has 2 programs with Level IV Reaccredited Status, 7 programs with Level IV Accredited Status, and 3 programs with Level III Reaccredited Status. T.I.P. Manila has 5 programs with Level IV Accredited Status and 7 programs with Level III Reaccredited Status.</p>
